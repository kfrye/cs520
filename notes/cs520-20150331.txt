The key to reusabiity is to minimize dependencies. Limiting the coupling.

All the class names in Java are global and once you've imported a class,
you can't change the name. 

Problems should be broken down into methods that have somewhere
between 2-10 steps. Everything in the method should be at the same
level of abstraction.

Need to put behavior in objects instead of clients of the objects.
Behavior does interesting things with the data inside the object.

The message is what the client sends to the object to get the method
to run. You don't call a method inside an object because it makes it
sounds like you are reaching into the object and telling it what
to do. Instead, you pass a message to an object and tell it what 
you would like it to do.
